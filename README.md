# PDF Renaming Utilities

This is a rough and hacky script that looks into the first page of PDF files to figure out
what they are, and propose (or applies) a new name to them based on their content.

## Supported PDFs

As this is aimed at my (@Flameeyes) own use, the list of supported PDFs pretty much
focuses on bills and statements from UK, Italian, or Irish services and banks.
