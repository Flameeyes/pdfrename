# PDF Renaming Utilities

This is a rough and hacky script that looks into the first page of PDF files to figure out
what they are, and propose (or applies) a new name to them based on their content.

## Supported PDFs

As this is aimed at my (@Flameeyes) own use, the list of supported PDFs pretty much
focuses on bills and statements from UK, Italian, or Irish services and banks.

## Usage

Set up the virtual environment as follows. Select the script for bash (Linux, OSX, etc.)
or Windows PowerShell (especially for Visual Studio Code).

```
$ python -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate  # bash
$ venv\Scripts\activate.ps1  # Windows PowerShell
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the venv is activated and the dependencies installed, you can run the script from the
directory and point it to one or more PDFs:

```
# Only prints suggested renames
(venv) $ python pdfrename/pdfrename.py unsortedbill.pdf

# Actually rename files
(venv) $ python pdfrename/pdfrename.py --rename unsortedbill.pdf

# Verifies names
(venv) $ python pdfrename/pdfrename.py --list_all "2155-10-28 - AWS - Neo - Bill.pdf"
```
